A simple, short C# program for my DB class. Program interact with postgreDB through ODBC - need [postgre ODBC driver](http://www.postgresql.org/ftp/odbc/versions/).

Server ip is hardcoded within the program, since it require special permission to log in, there are little anyone can do about it. Username and password was not hardcoded due to obvious reasons.

Program was fairly simple and quick to write, since I've used ODBC before (technically, it's OLEDB - a different API but the usage is almost the same). Didn't run into any significant problem.
